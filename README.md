# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Comments
I am working on fixing up the firebase connections because the old firebase app I was using was deleted. Otherwise this is a good project demonstration of a react native / typescript expo app
